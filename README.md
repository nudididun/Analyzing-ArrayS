# Analyzing-Arrays
This program will declare and initialize two arrays of random numbers and compare their elements 

Program Instructions from teacher:

-You must implement a method called printTwoArrays that will take two arrays and print them to console side-by-side and justified. Both arrays must be of int data type and their sizes should be declared using a variable called elements

-The arguments for the limits for the random range should be defined by the variables low_limit and high_limit. These two variables should be passed to the methods to initialize the arrays.

-You must implement a method called compareArrays that will compare the two arrays to determine which array had the most “position by position” values that were greater than the other. You should also provide for ties. For example for the array content example below:

content of array 1:  5, 8, 13, 24, 11, 56, 13

content of array 2:  7, 4, 3, 6, 33, 15, 5

...array 1 has 5 positions with higher values than array 2, while array 2 has only 2 higher values then array 1 for each isolated position. There are no two values in the same position that are the same, so no ties.
